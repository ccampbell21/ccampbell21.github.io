Here, I will show how we can use reticulate to demonstrate the ways in which R and Python can work together and use information.

This is my last semester at UT, so to wrap up the semester, I will use `reticulate` to celebrate! 

Starting off with an R code chunk, we can set the first vector to "Class of 2021".

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

year<-"Class of 2021"
```

Now, using a Python code chunk, we can set the second vector to "Graduation". Putting them together with `print()` and using `r.` to access R-defined objects, we get "Class of 2021 Graduation".

```{python}
#Python code chunk
semester="Graduation"
print(r.year,semester) 
```

Similarly, we can get the same result using `cat(c())` and `py$` to access Python-defined objects within an R code chunk.

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(year,py$semester))
```
